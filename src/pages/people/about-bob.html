              <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mb-3">About Marc</h2>
              <p>Marc’s journey began in the U.S. Air Force, specializing in Electronic Switching Systems—where
                precision, reliability, and mission‑critical communications were non‑negotiable. Since then, he has held
                roles from hands‑on technician to senior leader, driving innovation in IT operations, cybersecurity, and
                service delivery.</p>
              <p><strong>Before founding Vulpine Solutions</strong>, Marc spent more than a decade at ConnectWise,
                rising from technical support to senior leadership in Partner Success. There, he worked with managed
                service providers across the globe, fine‑tuning their operations, strengthening their cybersecurity
                posture, and helping them achieve measurable growth.</p>
              <p>Today, Marc leads Vulpine Solutions with one clear mission: <em>deliver secure, reliable, and
                  stress‑free IT that lets small and midsize businesses focus on what they do best.</em> He personally
                oversees everything from strategic vision and solution design to hands‑on implementation—ensuring every
                engagement is practical, efficient, and business‑focused.</p>

              <h3 class="h5 fw-bold mb-3">Beyond the Keyboard</h3>
              <p>Off the clock, Marc is a devoted husband to Lisa—a middle school teacher at the Academy of the Holy
                Names and a master’s candidate in curriculum design—and a proud dad of four (ages 12, 13, 20, and 22).
                Two energetic dogs complete the household. A self‑proclaimed “nerd at heart,” Marc is happiest when he’s
                learning, tinkering, or building—assembling a custom Voron 3D printer, experimenting with Kubernetes,
                automating his home, or designing electronics projects with ESP32s. He also loves to travel, cook, and
                explore new adventures with his family.</p>
